# Web-chat-app-with-language-detection-and-translation
•	There are few situations where the users communicate with the punch lines/ phrases of other languages in a chat interface, where they must look up the meaning online. 
•	Therefore, significance of language in our everyday lives is more multidimensional than we realize and solely operating in English can hold back companies and businesses. 
•	Our team proposes a solution to overcome the language barrier by implementing language detection and translation in the chat interface, where the users can translate texts from a language (unknown to them) to a preferred language. 
•	Language detection and translation with NLP and text analytics is done by using MulitnomialNB, langdetect and other NLP libraries that are based on sequence2sequence modelling. React will be used for the user interface, Sockets for the chat application and backend will be implemented using Flask.
